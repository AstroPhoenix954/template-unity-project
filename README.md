This is a template Unity project [Omiya Games](https://www.omiyagames.com/)' uses to start their game project.
In this Unity project, the following folders has the following roles:

- Assets:
    - A folder required by Unity.  Contains assets used for the game.  See the [README.md](/Assets/README.md) in that folder for more details.
- Builds:
    - A folder where its contents are ignored by Git.  Typically where game builds are created in.
- UnimportedAssets:
    - A folder that Git versions, but Unity doesn't detect.  Typically where unfinished art assets are placed in.
